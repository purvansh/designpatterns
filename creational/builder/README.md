This design pattern allows us to create a object with complex attributes, and with various variations. For Example If we have a house class and it has a attribute wall this can contain brick wall , cement wall or wooden wall any kind of wall that the user specifies. This design pattern helps us in solving the issue by easing the task of creating these objects.
